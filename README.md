# cfworker-redirect-joshthomasdev

A simple Cloudflare Worker to redirect the domain I previously used for my personal site ([joshuadavidthomas.com](https://joshuadavidthomas.com)) to the new, cooler one ðŸ˜Ž ([joshthomas.dev](https://joshthomas.dev)).

## Getting Started

4. Make changes to the code in `src/index.ts` and test them out at `http://localhost:8787`.

5. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers when ready. You will be prompted to login to Cloudflare via OAuth if you haven't already.

   ```
